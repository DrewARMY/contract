# Base ERC-20 Contract

This contract is the next iteration of [Drew Roberts](https://github.com/drewroberts) tokenomics for [Drew Roberts Digital](https://github.com/roberts) releases. It builds on the success of the [ApeHaven](https://github.com/apehaven) project and adds additional flexibility with reduced gas fees. It is the new base structure for future projects led by [Drew Roberts](https://drewroberts.com) and his [Team](https://drewroberts.com).
